### About & History of this project 🤓
---------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time, I embarked on a journey into the world of web development. 
Inspired by a captivating portfolio website, I was initially demoralized by the advanced technologies used, such as Framer-Motion-Animations, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, I saw this as an opportunity for growth and dedicated myself to learning. Over two months, I tirelessly studied and practiced, acquiring the skills to build the once seemingly unattainable portfolio project from scratch
<br/>
<br/>
Not only did I replicate the design, but I also added my own innovative ideas and enhancements. This experience taught me the importance of tenacity, adaptability, and continuous learning in web development.
<br/>
I hope my journey inspires other developers and showcases my ability to overcome challenges and strive for excellence. My story reflects resilience, adaptability, and a commitment to personal and professional development, making me a valuable asset to any team or organization.

### 🏃‍♂️💨 Running this project locally 🏃‍♂️💨
---------------------------------------------------

System Requirements:
<ul>
<li>Node.js 16.8 or later.
<li>macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.
</ul>

First, Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Third, Open up <code>localhost:3000</code> to view your application. <br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

<ul>
<li>You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
<li>[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.
<li>The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
<li>This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
</ul>
<br>

### 👷‍♂️🏗 Building and Deploying on Vercel 👷‍♂️🏗 
---------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
